This repository holds the docker image for running the **seed inference tutorial** in the Chapter 
*"Prediction of source nutrients for microorganisms using metabolic networks"*, in the book *Computational Methods for Molecular Microbiology* (Springer, upcoming). 

It includes the necessary files for running the tutorial (including two python scripts, two bash scripts, four text files, and two SBML metabolic models), all of which are further described in the Chapter.

This information can also be found permanantly hosted on recherche-data-gouv at https://doi.org/10.57745/3Z5L45
